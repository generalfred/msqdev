msqdev - Megasquirt development (tuning) system

INTRODUCTON
-----------

The [Megasquirt][megasquirt] engine controller allows for the
control of nearly every possible parameter of a running engine.
But this wide spectrum of parameters also makes it difficult to tune.
The typical tuning method is based on rules of thumb
and imprecise judgements of performance.
The Msqdev system was created to provide a
methodical method of tuning with provable metrics of performance.

More in depth documentation is provided in the 'doc' directory
of this package.
